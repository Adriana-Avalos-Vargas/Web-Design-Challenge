                        that most of the points are located below the value of 15 mph. Also in a given latitude there might be a wide 
                        variety of wind speeds. However, this last sentence has to be taken with care.<br>
                        Matthew Cappucci wrote in his article <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/explainer-winds-and-where-they-come">Explainer: Winds and where they come from </a> that:
                        <i>"There are many different types of wind. Each forms in different ways. But essential to all are changes in air 
                        pressure. TV weather forecasters regularly point on maps to areas of high and low pressure. And that makes
                        sense because changes in air pressure are what lead to wind — the flow of air. In fact, wind is Mother Nature’s way 
                        of equalizing differences in air pressure. <br>
                        Air pressure is the force that air exerts toward whatever contains it. The pressure of air in a balloon is higher than 
                        that of the air outside. That’s why most of the air will leave a balloon whenever it gets a hole. When it comes to the 
                        atmosphere, air pressure describes the weight of air over a given site. It is determined by that parcel of air’s 
                        temperature, volume and density.<br>
                        Expanding air produces regions of “high pressure.” These push nearby air away. Contracting air creates zones of “low pressure.” They pull nearby air inward. That’s why the wind blows: It moves from regions of high pressure to those where pressure is lower. The zone between the high- and low-pressure areas is known as a pressure gradient, or a zone over which the pressure varies from high to low.
                        cloud is an assembly of tiny water and/or ice particles in the atmosphere above the Earth's surface. The 
                        individual cloud particles usually are too small to be resolved by the human eye unless they are magnified, 
                        therefore, clouds tend to appear as solid forms. Cloud differs from fog only by definition, since fogs are in
                         contact with the Earth's surface. Cloudiness or cloud cover refers to the extent to which the atmosphere is 
                         covered by cloud and is estimated in fractions or percent. Overcast refers to near 100% cloudiness while 
                         clearrefers to near 0% cloudiness. The term cloudiness most often describes the horizontal extent of clouds, 
                         including all cloud altitudes as viewed from a weather station on the Earth or a satellite in space. From 
                         either viewpoint, the observations are sensitive to the shapes, sizes, and altitudes of clouds so that 
                         cloudiness estimates depend to some extent on the vertical structure of clouds</i>".</p>
